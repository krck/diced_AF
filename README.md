# diced_AF (Atmel Firmware)

## About
- For now: Arduino Playground
- Future plan: Handheld Dice-Roller Device

## Setup (Linux)
Development is done as "bare bones" as possible. No Arduino IDE, no Atmel Studio. Keep the toolchain simple without any bloated installations. But a few packages/libs are needed:
- binutils
- gcc-avr
- avr-libc
- avrdude
